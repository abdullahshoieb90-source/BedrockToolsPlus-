# BedrockToolsPlus

## Introduction

BedrockToolsPlus is an open-source native mod for Minecraft Bedrock on Android, made for [LeviLauncher](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLaunchroid). It ships the **Hitbox** module — entity hitbox rendering in the world — on top of a small C++ SDK and event system for native mod development.

The source is public so people can study how a real LeviLauncher mod is structured, learn from it, and use the SDK as a starting point for their own mods.

## Features

- Native C++20 mod built for LeviLauncher and Preloader
- The Hitbox module with per-kind toggles, eye/look lines, and three colors
- Public headers for Minecraft wrappers, offsets, signatures, and utilities
- Typed event system with runtime subscriptions for other native mods
- LeviLauncher mod-menu integration and persistent configuration
- Open-source and designed to be practical to extend

## Hitbox

**Hitbox** draws wireframe hitboxes around actors in the world (a `RenderLevel` overlay with the game's own selection material):

- **Entities** (on by default) — mob hitboxes
- **Players** (on by default) — other players' hitboxes
- **Self** (on by default) — your own hitbox, shown in third person only (in first person the camera sits inside it)
- **Eye Line** (on by default) — a short vertical tick at the eye position
- **Look Line** (on by default) and **Look Line Length** — a beam along the look direction
- **Hitbox Color**, **Eye Line Color**, **Look Line Color** — three independent color pickers
- Actors under the invisibility effect are skipped; everything within 30 blocks is drawn

## System Requirements

- Android 9 or newer
- 64-bit ARM device (`arm64-v8a`)
- [LeviLauncher](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLaunchroid)
- Minecraft Bedrock **1.26.50** (`1.26.50.4`) — the version declared in `levimod.json`; other builds may work but are untested

## Installation

1. Install LeviLauncher.
2. Download the latest `BedrockToolsPlus.levipack` release.
3. Import the package from LeviLauncher's mod manager and enable it.
4. Launch Minecraft through LeviLauncher.

## Development Setup

Requirements:

- Android NDK r28c
- xmake
- Python 3

Build for Android ARM64:

```sh
xmake f -y -p android -a arm64-v8a -m release --ndk=/path/to/android-ndk-r28c
xmake -y
```

The release build produces `libBedrockToolsPlus.so` and `BedrockToolsPlus.levipack` in the xmake target directory.

Public SDK headers are under `include/bedrocktools`. Shared runtime code lives under `src/core`, while features are kept under `src/modules` by category. Minecraft signatures and offsets are version-specific, so those are the main pieces that normally need updating for a new game build.

Host-side smoke checks:

```sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

Example event subscription from another native mod:

```cpp
#include <bedrocktools/BedrockToolsPlus.hpp>

bedrocktools::events::RuntimeListener<bedrocktools::events::LocalPlayerTickEvent> listener(
    [](auto& event) {
        if (!event.player) return;
        auto position = event.player->position();
    }
);
```
