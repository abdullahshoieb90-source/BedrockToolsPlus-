# BedrockToolsPlus

## Introduction

BedrockToolsPlus is an open-source native mod for Minecraft Bedrock on Android, made for [LeviLauncher](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLaunchroid). It adds a collection of visual, HUD, player, and utility modules while also providing a small C++ SDK and event system for native mod development.

The source is public so people can study how a real LeviLauncher mod is structured, learn from it, and use the SDK as a starting point for their own mods.

## Features

- Native C++20 mod built for LeviLauncher and Preloader
- 46 configurable modules
- Public headers for Minecraft wrappers, offsets, signatures, and utilities
- Typed event system with runtime subscriptions for other native mods
- LeviLauncher mod-menu integration and persistent configuration
- Open-source and designed to be practical to extend

## Modules

**Visual:** Fullbright, Motion Blur, Fog Color, Glint Color, TNT Timer, NoFog, View Model, Third Person Nametag, Chunk Border, Block Outline, Hitbox, Zoom, Breadcrumbs, FPS Unlocker, Light Overlay, ShulkerPreview, Connected Glass

**HUD:** Ping Counter, Reach Counter, Combo Display, Break Indicator, Player Coords, Compass, Speed Display, Effect Display, Debug Menu, Keystrokes, Tablist, Crosshair

**Player:** Time Changer, Weather Changer, Nick, Skin Stealer, Custom Capes, AutoGG, AutoReQ

**Misc:** No Disconnect, Chat Timestamps, No Touch Border, CPS Limiter

## Custom Capes

The **Custom Capes** module lets you wear any PNG as a classic cape.

1. Put cape images (`.png`, ideally 64x32 — any other size is scaled automatically) into the `capes` folder next to your `config.json` (`<mod config dir>/capes`, created automatically on first launch along with a sample cape).
2. (Re)launch the game, open the BedrockToolsPlus mod menu and enable **Custom Capes**.
3. Pick a file in the module's **Cape** selector — the cape updates in-game immediately. Choose `None` to bring your vanilla cape back.

Images that are not exactly 64x32 are scaled onto the cape's outer back face (`x=1..11, y=1..17` of the 64x32 cape canvas); the inner front face gets a flat lining color instead of a repeat of the image, and the top/bottom/side edge strips pick up the image's edge colors so the cape keeps its visible thickness. Exact 64x32 images are used pixel-for-pixel with no processing.

The change is fully client-side and visual only; it does not affect servers, accounts, or other players. Persona skins are not affected (capes are persona pieces there).

## Wings

The **Wings** module renders animated 3D wings on your back that flap, idle and glide with your movement. Open the module's **Wing Style** selector to choose a shape:

- **Dragon** — the default articulated membrane wing
- **Angel** — white feathered blades with gold tips
- **Demon** — deep-red spiky membrane
- **Bat** — small dark membrane
- **Butterfly** — pink/orange panels with blue accents
- **Phoenix** — fiery orange feathers
- **Fairy** — small translucent cyan/pink wings

The wings are a world-space overlay (a `RenderLevel` hook + tessellator); they never touch skin memory and only appear from a third-person point of view. Each style is drawn as closed, tapered feather prisms with a rest-pose fan, a backwards sweep and per-face shading, so the wings read as real 3D volume. Developers can preview every style offline (and compare against the legacy renderer) with `./scripts/gen_wings_preview.sh`, which writes PNGs to `build/wings-preview/`.

## System Requirements

- Android 9 or newer
- 64-bit ARM device (`arm64-v8a`)
- [LeviLauncher](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLaunchroid)
- A Minecraft Bedrock version supported by the BedrockToolsPlus release you are using

## Installation

1. Install LeviLauncher.
2. Download the latest `BedrockToolsPlus.levipack` release.
3. Import the package from LeviLauncher's mod manager and enable it.
4. Launch Minecraft through LeviLauncher.

## Development Setup

Requirements:

- Android NDK r28c
- xmake
- Python 3

Build for Android ARM64:

```sh
xmake f -y -p android -a arm64-v8a -m release --ndk=/path/to/android-ndk-r28c
xmake -y
```

The release build produces `libBedrockToolsPlus.so` and `BedrockToolsPlus.levipack` in the xmake target directory.

Public SDK headers are under `include/bedrocktools`. Shared runtime code lives under `src/core`, while features are kept under `src/modules` by category. Minecraft signatures and offsets are version-specific, so those are the main pieces that normally need updating for a new game build.

Example event subscription from another native mod:

```cpp
#include <bedrocktools/BedrockToolsPlus.hpp>

bedrocktools::events::RuntimeListener<bedrocktools::events::LocalPlayerTickEvent> listener(
    [](auto& event) {
        if (!event.player) return;
        auto position = event.player->position();
    }
);
```
